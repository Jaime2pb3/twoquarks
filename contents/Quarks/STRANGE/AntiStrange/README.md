# ANTI-STRANGE — TwoQuarks Flavor

ANTI-STRANGE is the stabilization-driven quark of the TwoQuarks framework.

It operates as the **consolidation and exploitation engine**, prioritizing memory dominance over oscillatory search.

ANTI-STRANGE minimizes thermal excitation, suppresses swarm oscillations, and reinforces learned proto-policies to achieve rapid convergence.
