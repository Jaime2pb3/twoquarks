# CHARM · Visual Diagnostics

This section contains visualization outputs for the CHARM experiment over the
Enchanted Valley environment.

Plots include:

- Episode reward convergence
- λ-field evolution over training
- Average polarization ρ̄ dynamics
- Structural diffusion field intensity

These graphics allow inspection of how structural shaping influences stability,
exploration paths, and convergence robustness under non-stationary conditions.
