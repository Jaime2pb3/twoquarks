# ANTI-STRANGE MODEL DESCRIPTION

ANTI-STRANGE inherits the HF-Levo core but reverses the thermal excitation logic.

---

## Control Law

The temperature regulator is inverted:



dT/dt = −E + R


This actively damps oscillations and collapses entropy.

---

## Policy Weighting

Proto-memory dominates gating:



π(s) ≈ proto(s)


Swarm consensus is only weakly blended when entropy spikes.

---

## Behavior Regime

ANTI-STRANGE enforces:

- Low thermal excitation
- Weak oscillatory HF modulation
- Persistent exploitation bias

Resulting dynamics:

✅ Extremely stable reward acquisition  
✅ Minimal policy wandering  
❌ Reduced exploration capability
