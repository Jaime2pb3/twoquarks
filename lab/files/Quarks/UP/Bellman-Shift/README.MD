# Bellman-Shift Stability Baseline

Objective: evaluate stability under structural reward-shift perturbations.

Key ideas
- Bellman update perturbed with shift term Δ.
- Tracks variance under controlled noise conditions.
- Measures resilience of Q(s,a) trajectories.

Outputs
- Stability curves (see GRAPHICS/).
- Δ–response maps.

Status: executed locally. Prototipe
